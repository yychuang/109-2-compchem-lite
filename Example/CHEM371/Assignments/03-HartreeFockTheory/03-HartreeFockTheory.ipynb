    "## Problem 1: The electronic structure of methane according to Hatree–Fock theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Methane is the prototypical example of an organic compound in which the carbon forms four equivalent sp$^3$ hybrid C-H bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build the structure of the methane molecule and optimize it at the Hartree–Fock level of theory using the def2-TZVP basis set ('scf/def2-TZVP').\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the orbital energies from Hartree–Fock theory, build a molecular orbital diagram. A molecular orbital diagram is just a plot of the orbital energies in which the y axis indicates the energy. You do not need to draw the diagram on scale. Indicate occupied orbitals with a line and two arrows, while empty orbitals just with a line. Label each orbital with its corresponding energy (in hartree). If two or more orbitals are degenerate, shows them as separate lines with the same y value. **It is enough if you show only the 9 lowest energy orbitals**.\n",

    "- Use the psi4.cubeprop command to generate cube files for occupied orbitals 2-5. Then plot them with the fortecubeview module. Take a snapshot of your orbitals and paste them into your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Koopman's theorem predict the ionization potential for all the orbitals of methane (in eV). Compare your values to the experimental values reported by NIST (https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Ionization/table.pl?ionization=CH4). Is the ordering of the IPs consistent between theory and experiment?\n",

    "- Use Koopman's theorem predict if the anion CH$_4^{-}$ is stable. Explain how you arrived at your answer."
