If you use `environment.yml`, then Binder will use a Miniconda distribution
to install your packages. However, you may still want to use `pip`. In
this case, you should **not** use a `requirements.txt` file, but instead use
a `- pip` section in `environment.yml`. This repository is an example of how
to construct your `environment.yml` file to accomplish this.
